# 🧮 Hospital Infection Admission Analysis (Excel-Based)

## 📌 Project Overview

On this project in the **Healthcare Analysis Insights Team**, I did an all Excel data analysis project to understand the **types of infections patients had at the time of hospital admission**. The goal was to identify trends that could guide **treatment planning**, **antibiotic inventory management**, and **department readiness**.

---

## 🎯 Goal of the Analysis

This project explored how patient-admitted infections influenced:

- Patient outcomes (Recovery, Complications, Death)
- Antibiotic resistance levels
- Department-level infection trends

The aim was to deliver actionable insights to hospital leadership and improve infection response strategies.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Pivot Tables
  - Filters and Conditional Formatting
  - Charts: Pie Charts, Bar Graphs
  - Basic Excel formulas (`=IF()`, `=COUNTIFS()`, `=VLOOKUP()`)

---

## 📊 Data Summary

- Total patients: **200**
- Timeframe: **January – April 2024**
- Key columns:
  - `Infection Detected`
  - `Department`
  - `Antibiotic Given`
  - `Resistance Level`
  - `Outcome`

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **76% of patients** (152/200) were already infected at admission.
- Most common infections:
  - **MRSA** – 47 cases
  - **C. difficile** – 45 cases
  - **Klebsiella** – 19 cases
- **ICU and Oncology** had the highest share of infected admissions.
- **Antibiotic resistance** was strongly linked to complications and deaths.
- Outcomes Breakdown:
  - ✅ Recovered: 161
  - ⚠️ Complications: 32
  - ❌ Deaths: 7

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Align antibiotic stock levels with infection patterns (e.g., Vancomycin for MRSA).
- Prioritize infection control measures in ICU and Oncology.
- Implement an admission-screening protocol for early detection and triage.

---

## 📈 Potential Impact

- Reduce complication rates by **15–20%**
- Prevent up to **5 deaths per year**
- Save **$90,000–$150,000 annually** through targeted treatment strategies

## 📁 Files Included

- `hospital_infection_data_v2.xlsx` – Raw and analyzed Excel file
- `summary_charts.xlsx` – Cleaned data, charts, and pivot dashboards
